Hello, Github!

Here are screenshots of my progress in Learning Git.

To assert the authenticity of these screenshots, I will provide another screenshot of the editing screen of the README document after I
have finished. Notice similarities in my task bar (icons and their layout on the bottom of the screen). Also, notice that Gavin Snyder's
Canvas submission will link to Arceus1ooo's repository. I also have provided extensive detail of my experience while completing this
assignment in an issue.
